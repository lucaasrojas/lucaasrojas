# Hi stranger, I’m Lucas 👋

Hey!👋 I'm Lucas, from Buenos Aires. I have been working as a software developer since 2018. I started with Visual Basic 6 and QBasic at school, and it has been a journey that will never end.

I've had the opportunity to delve into different languages and technologies such as Vue.js, React.js, Gatsby, AWS, Azure DevOps, Redis, Bash scripts, and more.

Since 2020, I have been working on the front end with React.js, Redux, Material-UI, and React Testing Library, and I feel that it is what I want to keep learning and working on 🧑‍💻.

As a self-taught person, I learn by doing, experimenting, and Googling. I am always looking for new challenges, meeting new cultures, finding new ways to do things, and learning about clean electricity, mechanics, 3D printing, sociology, product design, and more. When I am not coding or building something, you will find me cycling or drinking a big cup of coffee.

Let's drink a coffee and talk 🍵
